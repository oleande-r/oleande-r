I'm a recent graduate from Northwestern University, interested in software development and passionate about narrative-focused video games.
* 🎮 I love video games— both playing and writing narratives for them.
* 💽 I'm a fullstack developer but I find myself gravitating towards backend development.
* 🌇 I have a general interest in astronomy. My pfp is of a solar eclipse that occured in 2008.
* 🎻 I spent many years playing the violin and am interested in music theory.
* 📖 In my freetime, I enjoy reading. If we're friends, ask for my <a href="https://www.thestorygraph.com/">Storygraph</a>.
